🌱 AI Crop Advisory Chatbot for Sustainable Agriculture

📌 Project Overview

The AI Crop Advisory Chatbot is a sustainability-focused project developed as part of the AI for Sustainability Virtual Internship (1M1B in collaboration with IBM SkillsBuild & AICTE).
The project aims to support farmers by providing instant, eco-friendly crop advisory using AI-driven conversational logic.

The chatbot helps users with guidance related to crop management, pest control, soil health, and fertilizer usage while promoting sustainable agricultural practices.

🎯 Problem Statement

Farmers often face challenges due to lack of timely and reliable agricultural guidance, leading to reduced crop yield, excessive chemical usage, and long-term environmental damage. Traditional advisory systems are limited in reach and accessibility. This project addresses the need for an easy-to-use AI-based solution that delivers sustainable farming recommendations.

🌍 SDG Alignment

This project aligns with the following United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):

SDG 2: Zero Hunger

SDG 3: Good Health and Well-Being

SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation

SDG 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities

SDG 15: Life on Land

🤖 AI Solution Description

The chatbot uses Conversational AI and rule-based intelligence to understand farmer queries and provide relevant crop advisory responses. It simulates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflow by mapping user inputs to curated agricultural knowledge and sustainability guidelines.

The system acts as a decision-support agent, assisting farmers without replacing human agricultural experts.

🛠 Technologies Used

Conversational AI (NLP) – To understand user queries

Rule-Based AI Logic – For decision-making and response generation

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) – Conceptual knowledge retrieval

Agentic AI (Decision-Support Agent) – Assists farmers with recommendations

IBM Granite Models (Conceptual Reference) – Responsible AI text generation

Streamlit – Web-based prototype development

Python – Core programming language
